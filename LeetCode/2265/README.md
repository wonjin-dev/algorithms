# 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

<br/>

**_Note:_**

The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.

<br/>

**_Constraints:_**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
